# Meteorite_Strikes
This repository holds my SQL code I used to clean data collected from data.nasa.gov and my Tabluea Dashboard  presenting my findings.
-Meteorites
	-The difference between small space bodies
		-Meteor, objects that are 2 meters or smaller that are rocky or metallic in composition
		-Meteorite, are peices of metoers or asteriods that fall to the Earth's surface
		-Comet, Is made up of primarily gas and dust
		-Asteroid, are small space bodies that orbit around the sun but are too small to be classiefied as a planet
	-Difference between classes
		-Irons, meteorites that contaion iron 
		-Chondrites, is a stony non-metallic meteorite that contain chondrites, molten droplets formed when in space.
		-Achondrites, is a stony non-metallc metorite that does not contian chondrites.
	-Some info about the data set
		-The data set was 45,716 rows long and 10 columns wide
		-The original data set contained info on the meoerite's name, id, class, mass, year and latitue and longitude
		-From here I knew I wanted to compare the meteorites sizes and when the landed or were found.
		-I also wanted to use the location give to try and create a map showing where they had fallen
		- Lastly I wanted to compare the three main classes to see which landed the most and which one was larger by mass.
